for this we first defined how many rows and colloms are there in the sprite
and stored them in an array 
its a 1D array
using the nested for loop we tell the code ass soon as it reaches the last sprite image it should go down i unit in the Y axis and run te loop again until it breaks or display all the sprite 
the play or pause of the sprite is set on mouse pressed and the position of the explosion is set on the mouse cusrour coordinates
