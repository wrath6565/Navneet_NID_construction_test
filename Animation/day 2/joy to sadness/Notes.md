Key Features
• Dynamic Motion: The `frameCount` variable is used to move many of the ellipses across the canvas.
• Central Ellipse: A central, orange circle's size shrinks continuously in the `draw()` loop via the `x` variable, making it appear to disappear.
• Color Palette: A simple, vibrant color scheme is used:
  • Background: `#89E9FF` (Light Blue/Cyan)
  • Circles: `#FF9D00` (Orange) and `#FFEA00` (Bright Yellow)
